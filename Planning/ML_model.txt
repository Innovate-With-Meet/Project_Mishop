The Affected Features of the Wild Fire:

1. temprature : range (-73 to 199 c)
    getting Affected temprature of the wild fire depend on the features 

2. humidity : range (0% to 100%)
    0% to 30% has the dry environment
    30% to 60% has the ideal environment
    60% to 100% has the cool environment

model_target_temp = 35c to 40c is the high risk of the fire
model_target_temp = 0% to 30% is the high risk of the fire

    temprature = {
        Fire : [cause_fire_temp_data : [40,35]],
    Not_Fire : [do_cause_fire_data : [32,34]]
    },

  humidity = {
        Fire : [cause_fire_temp_data : [0%, 30%]],
    Not_Fire : [do_cause_fire_data : [60%, 100%]]
}

Doubt: 90% wildfire cause by human activites so need to Prevents to spread accross area.
1. Large Amount of campaing so the ratios is higher of the fire is higher of the season is dry.
2. In the summer season the ratios is also higher in dry forest area.
3. Dry area and with Human intervantion and high wind and high temprature is alos spread the wild fire.

Aim: 
1.To Predict the Wild Fire TO occured by Monitoring.
2.If Fire is occured so what is the damages calculation of the area and neighbors.
3.If Fire is occured so how many Fire Teams and Resources are needed to Prevents the Fire Based on the intensity of the Fire.
4.If Fire occured How many lifes are been in dangor's in the forest and the neighbors both wildlife and human socity.
5.All Anayses calculation If The Fire is occured so what is the damages- and next step and all other things need to do of the govt agencys.
6.Etc.


Aim:
Climent Change Idea OF the prediction of the Effect on the land, Sea, Sky.
